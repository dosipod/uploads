Sure the tip for pictures  is use gifs instead as even one frame gif  will work without issues on large fixtures   , this example in the video is setup as 80x44 matrix 
( does not matter if it is an lcd or a matrix )  . 
As you can see the internal effects may struggle a bit but gifs are fine , you could try this even without a fixture by seeing the result on peek .
